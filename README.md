# Landfill Analytical: Hungary 2022-2023

## Overview
This repository hosts the web interface component of my thesis project at University Of Miskolc, developed Under the supervision of Prof. Dr. JÃ³zsef Faitli, It's developed to visualize Landfill Analytical data, showcasing interactive charts and graphs for a comprehensive analysis.

## Project Context
This web interface is part of a larger research project undertaken for my master's thesis in Environmental Engineering at University Of Miskolc. The project covering the years 2022 and 2023. The focus is on categorizing waste under various streams, including Deposit Return System (DRS), Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), and others.

## Accessing the Interface
- You can use the interface by this link https://aladdinalmarashly.github.io/landfillAnalyticalHungaryMid2022Mid2023
- The interface is hosted with limited access at: https://eeis.atjed.com/

## Features
- Interactive web interface for data visualization
- Graphical charts and graphs representing waste management metrics
- The full project developed with Python, NodeJS, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## Data Categories

### Waste Streams
The datasets are organized into the following waste stream categories:
1. **DRS-W**: Waste categorized under the Deposit Return System.
2. **EPR-P**: Waste managed under Extended Producer Responsibility programs.
3. **Plastic**: Various forms of plastic waste.
4. **Bio**: Biologically decomposable waste.
5. **Food**: Waste consisting of food items.

### Time Frames
The data is structured into two main years, each subdivided into different seasons:
1. **2022**
   - Autumn
   - Winter
2. **2023**
   - Spring
   - Summer

### Types of Waste
For each time frame, the data includes the following categories:
- Selective municipal solid waste (SMSW)
- Mixed municipal solid waste (MSW)
- Public cleaning waste
- Illegally deposited waste

### NUTS2 Regions in Hungary
The study covers the following NUTS2 regions:
- Budapest
- Pest county
- Central Transdanubia
- Western Transdanubia
- South Transdanubia
- Northern Hungary
- Northern Great Plain
- Southern Great Plains
